# TriviaGame

This is a classic Trivia Game with a countdown timer. It is a very minimalistic approach to design, trying to achieve a look and and feel of pure contrast. The questions and answers can be adjusted. For the correct answer it will be in the variable "a1" which the program then shuffles around so that it is not in the same spot.
